*Call Me by Your Name (Italian: Chiamami col tuo nome) is a 2017 coming-of-age romantic drama film directed by Luca Guadagnino. Its screenplay, by James Ivory, who also co-produced, is based on the 2007 novel of the same title by André Aciman. The film is the final installment in Guadagnino's thematic "Desire" trilogy, after I Am Love (2009), and A Bigger Splash (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, Call Me by Your Name chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), and Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father Samuel (Michael Stuhlbarg), an archaeology professor. The film also stars actresses Amira Casar, Esther Garrel, and Victoire Du Bois.*

*Two of the film's producers, Peter Spears and Howard Rosenman, saw a galley proof of André Aciman's debut novel Call Me by Your Name in 2007 and "optioned" the screen rights before its publication.[28] Rosenman first heard about the book through a friend after acting in Milk (2008) and described it as "divine".[29] Spears, moved by the novel and believing it deserved a cinematic adaptation, received his first credit as a producer from his work on the film.[30] They invited their friend James Ivory to work as an executive producer on the film adaptation.[31] Spears and Rosenman began production in 2008,[32] but the project was soon trapped in "development hell".[33] The producers met with three sets of directors and writers—among them Gabriele Muccino, Ferzan Özpetek, and Sam Taylor-Johnson[34]—but could not find anyone who would commit to the project.[28][35] Scheduling filming in Italy during the summer also proved difficult.*

*In 2015, Shia LaBeouf and Greta Scacchi were reportedly set to be cast in the film.[58] In September 2016, Ivory confirmed they were no longer involved in the project. Ivory said he got along with LaBeouf, who had read for the film in New York City, but the production company later felt the actor was unsuitable after his "various troubles". Ivory thought Scacchi and LaBeouf read well together and could have made it into the film, but the company disagreed.*
